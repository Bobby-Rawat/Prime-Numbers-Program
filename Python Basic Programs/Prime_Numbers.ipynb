{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h2>What is a Prime Number ?</h2>\n","\n","<h5>Prime numbers are natural numbers that are divisible by only 1 and the number itself. In other words, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. Some of the prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Always remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite. Also, we can say that except for 1, the remaining numbers are classified as prime and composite numbers. All prime numbers are odd numbers except 2, 2 is the smallest prime number and is the only even prime number.</h5>"],"metadata":{"id":"yyINeMLoCHM2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h1>Prime Number Program</h1>"],"metadata":{"id":"I7jRbUkfCYJC"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3bAwgOwBx9LL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699633120208,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2692,"user":{"displayName":"Bobby Rawat","userId":"15040736754731218919"}},"outputId":"48178348-2b77-46b0-d339-5fc7811d3616"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter the Number : 97\n","It is a Prime Number\n"]}],"source":["num=float(input(\"Enter the Number : \"))\n","if(num%2==0)or(num%3==0)or(num%5==0)or(num%7==0)or(num%11==0):\n","\tprint( \"It is not a Prime Number\")\n","else:\n","\tprint(\"It is a Prime Number\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h2>History of Prime Numbers</h2>\n","\n","<h5>The prime number was discovered by Eratosthenes (275-194 B.C., Greece). He took the example of a sieve to filter out the prime numbers from a list of natural numbers and drain out the composite numbers. Students can practise this method by writing the positive integers from 1 to 100, circling the prime numbers, and putting a cross mark on composites. This kind of activity refers to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</h5>"],"metadata":{"id":"oipT64qX6jpk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h2>How to find prime numbers?</h2>\n","\n","<h5>To find whether a number is prime, try dividing it with the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. If the number is exactly divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number, otherwise, it is a prime. Alternatively, we can find the prime numbers by writing their factors since a prime number has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself.</h5>"],"metadata":{"id":"whx_HpENmw7U"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"9Jpo70uiBcTD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"N27AuIrc_hsL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"mount_file_id":"1-c8T034WScpg3rjUmKU6E2GLHUeX2OJf","authorship_tag":"ABX9TyP7WyiNjBtMdaGgVFsnvyeO"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
