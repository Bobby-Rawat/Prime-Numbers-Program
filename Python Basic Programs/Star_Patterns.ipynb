The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop controls the number of columns. The number of stars and whitespaces in each row depends on the logic of the program. A basic example of star pattern is printing a rectangle of stars.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"g0D8DptopcFO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h2> The Program Logic : </h2>\n","Normally we use nested for loops to print star shapes in Python.\n","\n","For example, the following Python program will need two nested for loops. The outer for loop is for rows and the inner for loop is for columns or stars.\n","\n","We use first for loop from 1 to N where N is the number of rows. Similarly, second for loop is used to print stars. We know that there is only one star in first row. There are two stars in line number two and so on. Hence we use second for loop from 1 to i. where i is the row number."],"metadata":{"id":"cWHotR7ImzcD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["num = int(input(\"Enter a Number : \"))\n","\n","for i in range(1, num+1):\n","    for j in range(1, i+1):\n","        print(\"*\",end=\"\")\n","    print()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HCvWnmlOfI07","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700331636855,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5265,"user":{"displayName":"Bobby Rawat","userId":"15040736754731218919"}},"outputId":"9d501f64-5527-47c8-9ae0-3b2e8a6c1700"},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a Number : 5\n","*\n","**\n","***\n","****\n","*****\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n","\n","Coding star pattern in python is an engaging and educational exercise that helps hone programming skills.
