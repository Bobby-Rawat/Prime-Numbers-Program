Prime Numbers with Python Programming

<h2>History of Prime Numbers</h2>
The prime number was discovered by Eratosthenes (275-194 B.C., Greece). He took the example of a sieve to filter out the prime numbers from a list of natural numbers and drain out the composite numbers.
Students can practise this method by writing the positive integers from 1 to 100, circling the prime numbers, and putting a cross mark on composites. This kind of activity refers to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

<h2>What are Prime Numbers?</h2>
Prime numbers are natural numbers that are divisible by only 1 and the number itself. In other words, prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. Some of the prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Always remember that 1 is neither prime nor composite. Also, we can say that except for 1, the remaining numbers are classified as prime and composite numbers. All prime numbers are odd numbers except 2, 2 is the smallest prime number and is the only even prime number.

<h2>How to find prime numbers ?</h2>
To find whether a number is prime, try dividing it with the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. If the number is exactly divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number, otherwise, it is a prime. Alternatively, we can find the prime numbers by writing their factors since a prime number has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself.
